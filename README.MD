*TIC-TAC-TOE (Starcraft edition)*
https://robvee88.github.io/Tic-TacToe/
  

This is the first project I did as part of the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly (Melbourne).

Features:

    - 3 different game-modes: (Human vs Human, Human vs CPU, CPU vs CPU).

    - Players can choose between the three different races of Starcraft: (Terran, Zerg & Protoss).

    - Customisable player names.

Lessons learned:

    - Think about all the features you want to implement and plan how you are going to implement each feature beforehand.

    - It is very easy to get stuck because the code becomes very hard to read or is too inefficient. Making any sort of 

      changes or trying to finds a bug can get very hard this way. In the end I rewrote most of the code to make it more 

      readable and more efficient. After that it was much easier to make any adjustments.
