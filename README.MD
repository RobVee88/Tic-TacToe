*TIC-TAC-TOE (Starcraft edition)*

This is the first project I did as part of the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly (Melbourne).

Features:
    - 3 different game-modes: (Human vs Human, Human vs CPU, CPU vs CPU).
    - Players can choose between the three different races of Starcraft: (Terran, Zerg & Protoss).
    - Customisable player names.

Lessons learned:
    - Think about all the features you want to implement and plan how you are going to implement each feature beforehand.
    
    - It is very easy to get stuck because the code becomes very hard to read or is too inefficient. Making any sort of changes or      trying to finds a bug can get very hard this way. In the end I rewrote most of the code to make it more readable and more         efficient. After that it was much easier to make any adjustments.
